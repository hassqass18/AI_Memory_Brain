## Skills (Detailed Reference)

### 1. Write Spec

**Trigger:** "write a spec for", "PRD for", "create a feature spec", "write the requirements for", "specification needed for"

**Workflow:**
1. Gather user problem, target users, success metrics, constraints, and prior art through conversational questioning
2. Pull context from connected tools (project tracker for related tickets, knowledge base for research, design tools for mockups)
3. Generate structured PRD with all sections detailed below
4. Iterate and refine with user feedback

**PRD Structure:**

- **Problem Statement** — 2-3 sentences describing the user problem, who is affected, cost of not solving it, grounded in evidence (research, support data, customer feedback)
- **Goals** — 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes tied to user or business metrics. Distinguish user goals from business goals. Outcomes, not outputs.
- **Non-Goals** — 3-5 things explicitly out of scope with rationale for each (not enough impact, too complex, separate initiative, premature). Prevents scope creep.
- **User Stories** — Standard format: "As a [user type], I want [capability] so that [benefit]". Include multiple personas, edge cases, ordered by priority.
- **Requirements** — Categorized as Must-Have (P0), Nice-to-Have (P1), and Future Considerations (P2), with acceptance criteria for each
- **Success Metrics** — Leading indicators (adoption, activation, task completion, error rate, feature frequency) and lagging indicators (retention, revenue, NPS, support reduction, win rate)
- **Open Questions** — Unresolved questions tagged with who should answer (engineering, design, legal, data) and whether blocking or non-blocking
- **Timeline Considerations** — Hard deadlines, dependencies, and phased delivery approach

**MoSCoW Framework for Requirements:**
- **Must have**: Without these, feature is not viable. Non-negotiable for launch.
- **Should have**: Important but not critical. High-priority fast follows post-launch.
- **Could have**: Desirable if time permits. Will not delay delivery if cut.
- **Won't have (this time)**: Explicitly out of scope. May revisit in future versions.

**Success Metrics Best Practices:**
- Set specific targets: "50% adoption within 30 days" not "high adoption"
- Base targets on comparable features, industry benchmarks, or explicit hypotheses
- Set "success" threshold and "stretch" target
- Define measurement method (tool, query, time window) and evaluation timing (1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter post-launch)

**Outputs:** Markdown PRD, follow-up artifacts (design brief, engineering ticket breakdown, stakeholder pitch)

### 2. Roadmap Update

**Trigger:** "update roadmap", "what should we build next", "roadmap planning session", "reprioritize features", "roadmap review", "add to roadmap"

**Workflow:**
1. Understand current state (pull from project tracker or accept user input in any format)
2. Determine operation: add item, update status, reprioritize, move timeline, or create new roadmap
3. Apply prioritization framework (RICE, MoSCoW, ICE, or value-vs-effort) if needed
4. Generate roadmap summary with status overview, items, risks/dependencies, and changes

**Roadmap Frameworks:**

**Now / Next / Later** (simplest, most effective):
- **Now** (current sprint/month): Committed work, high confidence in scope/timeline
- **Next** (1-3 months): Planned work, good confidence what, less confidence when
- **Later** (3-6+ months): Directional, flexible scope and timing

**Quarterly Themes**: Organize around 2-3 strategic themes per quarter aligned to OKRs. Explains WHY you are building what you are building.

**OKR-Aligned Roadmap**: Map initiatives directly to Objectives and Key Results with expected impact on each KR.

**Timeline / Gantt View**: Calendar-based with start/end dates, durations, parallelism, dependencies. Good for execution planning, NOT for external communication (creates false precision).

**Prioritization Frameworks:**

**RICE Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort**
- **Reach**: How many users/customers in given time period (concrete numbers)
- **Impact**: How much will this move the needle? (3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal)
- **Confidence**: How confident in estimates? (100%=high, backed by data; 80%=medium; 50%=low, gut feel)
- **Effort**: Person-months of work including engineering, design, and other functions

Use when: Quantitative, defensible prioritization for large backlogs. Less good for strategic bets where impact is hard to estimate.

**MoSCoW** (Must, Should, Could, Won't):
- **Must have**: Roadmap is a failure without these. Non-negotiable.
- **Should have**: Important and expected but delivery viable without them.
- **Could have**: Desirable but clearly lower priority. Include only if capacity allows.
- **Won't have**: Explicitly out of scope for this period.

Use when: Scoping a release or quarter. Negotiating with stakeholders. Forcing prioritization conversations.

**ICE Score (1-10 on each) = Impact x Confidence x Ease**
- **Impact**: How much will this move the target metric?
- **Confidence**: How confident in the impact estimate?
- **Ease**: How easy to implement? (Inverse of effort — higher = easier)

Use when: Quick prioritization of feature backlog. Early-stage products or when lacking data for RICE.

**Value vs Effort Matrix** (2x2):
- **High value, Low effort** (Quick wins): Do first
- **High value, High effort** (Big bets): Plan carefully, worth investment
- **Low value, Low effort** (Fill-ins): Do when spare capacity
- **Low value, High effort** (Money pits): Do not do

**Dependency Mapping:**
- **Technical dependencies**: Feature B requires infrastructure from Feature A
- **Team dependencies**: Feature requires work from another team (design, platform, data)
- **External dependencies**: Vendor, partner, or third-party integration
- **Knowledge dependencies**: Research or investigation before starting
- **Sequential dependencies**: Must ship A before starting B

Assign owner to each dependency. Set "need by" date. Build buffer around dependencies (highest-risk items). Flag cross-team dependencies early. Have contingency plan if dependency slips.

**Capacity Planning:**
- Start with engineers available and time period
- Subtract overhead (meetings, on-call, interviews, holidays, PTO) — rule of thumb: 60-70% on planned feature work
- Healthy allocation: 70% planned features, 20% technical health, 10% unplanned buffer
- If roadmap exceeds capacity, cut scope not estimates

**Outputs:** Roadmap in chosen format (Now/Next/Later, quarterly themes, OKR-aligned), status overview, dependencies list, risk assessment, change summary, stakeholder communication plan

### 3. Sprint Planning

**Trigger:** "sprint planning", "plan the sprint", "scope for next sprint", "estimate capacity for sprint", "set sprint goals", "sprint kickoff"

**Workflow:**
1. Gather team capacity (account for PTO, meetings, on-call)
2. Plan to 70-80% capacity with buffer for interrupts
3. Scope backlog items with prioritization (P0/P1/P2)
4. Identify dependencies and risks
5. Set one clear sprint goal
6. Generate sprint plan document

**Capacity Planning Formula:**
- Available days = (Team size × Sprint days) - PTO - Meetings - On-call rotations - Ramp time for new members
- Target allocation = 70-85% utilization (leave buffer for interrupts)
- Load = sum of estimated story points/hours for sprint items

**P0 / P1 / Stretch Categorization:**
- **P0 (Must ship)**: Required to achieve sprint goal. Non-negotiable.
- **P1 (Should ship)**: Advance sprint goal. Include if capacity allows.
- **P2 (Stretch)**: Nice-to-have. First things cut if blocked or overloaded.

**Carryover Analysis:**
- Understand why items did not ship last sprint
- Re-commit only if understanding is resolved
- Do not carry over more than 10-20% of capacity

**Definition of Done Checklist:**
- Code reviewed and merged
- Tests passing (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)
- Documentation updated (if applicable)
- Product sign-off / acceptance criteria met
- Deployed to staging or production (depending on team process)

**Sprint Plan Output Template:**
```
## Sprint [Name/Number]
**Dates:** [Start] — [End] | **Team:** [X] engineers
**Sprint Goal:** [One clear sentence about what success looks like]

### Capacity

### 4. Metrics Review

**Trigger:** "metrics review", "performance dashboard", "investigate spike in", "why did metric drop", "metrics scorecard", "performance review"

**Workflow:**
1. Gather metrics data (pull from analytics or accept user input)
2. Organize by metrics hierarchy: North Star → L1 health → L2 diagnostic
3. Analyze trends (current value, previous period, vs target, rate of change, anomalies)
4. Identify correlations between metrics
5. Generate review with scorecard, trend analysis, bright spots, concerns, recommendations

**Product Metrics Hierarchy:**

**North Star Metric** (single metric capturing core value):
- Value-aligned: Moves when users get more value
- Leading: Predicts long-term business success
- Actionable: Product team can influence it
- Understandable: Everyone understands why it matters

Examples: Weekly active teams with 3+ members, Weekly transactions completed, Weekly active users completing core workflow, Weekly deployments using the tool

**L1 Metrics (Health Indicators) — 5-7 key metrics across user lifecycle:**

| Stage | Metrics |
|-------|---------|
| **Acquisition** | New signups/trial starts, Signup conversion rate, Channel mix, Cost per acquisition |
| **Activation** | Activation rate (% who complete key action), Time to activate, Setup completion rate, First value moment |
| **Engagement** | DAU/WAU/MAU, DAU/MAU ratio (stickiness), Core action frequency, Session depth, Feature adoption % |
| **Retention** | D1/D7/D30 retention, Cohort retention curves, Churn rate, Resurrection rate |
| **Monetization** | Free-to-paid conversion, MRR/ARR, ARPU/ARPA, Expansion revenue, Net revenue retention |
| **Satisfaction** | NPS, CSAT, Support volume/resolution time, App store ratings, Review sentiment |

**L2 Metrics (Diagnostic)** — Detailed metrics for investigating L1 changes:
- Funnel conversion at each step
- Feature-level usage and adoption
- Segment-specific breakdowns (plan, company size, geography, role)
- Performance metrics (page load, error rate, API latency)
- Content-specific engagement

**Common Metrics Definitions:**

**DAU / WAU / MAU**: Unique users performing qualifying action (define "active" carefully: login vs page view vs core action matters).

**Retention**: Of users from period X, what % are active in period Y? Plot D1/D7/D30 cohorts. Flat curve = good; initial drop = activation problem; steady decline = engagement problem.

**Conversion**: % moving from one stage to next. Identify biggest drop-offs (highest-leverage improvement opportunities). Segment by source, plan, user type.

**Activation**: % reaching moment they first experience core value. Must be strongly predictive of long-term retention. Achievable in first session or few days.

**Metrics Scorecard Template:**

| Metric | Current | Previous | Change | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| [Metric] | [Value] | [Value] | [+/- %] | [Target] | [On track / At risk / Miss] |

**Metrics Review Cadences:**

**Weekly**: North Star + key L1 metrics + active experiments. 15-30 min. Catch issues quickly.

**Monthly**: Full L1 scorecard with MoM trends, progress against quarterly OKRs, cohort analysis, feature adoption, segment analysis. 30-60 min. Deeper analysis.

**Quarterly**: OKR scoring, L1 trend analysis, YoY comparison, competitive context, market changes. 60-90 min. Strategic assessment.

**Goal-Setting Frameworks:**

**OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):**
- **Objectives**: Qualitative, aspirational, time-bound (quarter or annual), directional
- **Key Results**: Quantitative, measurable, time-bound, outcome-based (not output), 2-4 per Objective
- Set for 70% completion as target. Too easy = not ambitious. Too hard = demoralizing.
- Grade honestly at end: 0.0-0.3 = missed, 0.4-0.6 = progress, 0.7-1.0 = achieved.

**Setting Targets:**
- **Baseline**: Current value with reliable measurement
- **Benchmark**: What comparable products achieve. Industry context.
- **Trajectory**: Current trend. If already improving 5% monthly, 6% target is not ambitious.
- **Effort**: How much investment? Bigger bets warrant more ambitious targets.
- **Confidence**: Set "commit" (high confidence) and "stretch" (ambitious).

**Dashboard Design Principles:**
1. Start with the question, not the data. Design backwards from the decision.
2. Hierarchy of information. North Star prominent, L1 next, L2 on drill-down.
3. Context over numbers. Always show: current, comparison (prior period/target/benchmark), trend.
4. Fewer metrics, more insight. 5-10 key metrics on main dashboard.
5. Consistent time periods. Do not mix daily and monthly metrics.
6. Visual status indicators (Green=on track, Yellow=needs attention, Red=off track).
7. Actionability. Only include metrics the team can influence.

**Alerting:**
- **Threshold alerts**: Metric drops below or rises above critical threshold
- **Trend alerts**: Sustained decline over multiple days/weeks
- **Anomaly alerts**: Deviates significantly from expected range
- Alert hygiene: Every alert must be actionable. Too many false positives = people ignore all alerts.

**Outputs:** Metrics scorecard with trends, narrative analysis of key changes, bright spots, areas of concern, recommended actions (investigate, experiment, invest, monitor), context and caveats

### 5. Stakeholder Update

**Trigger:** "stakeholder update", "status for leadership", "create board brief", "executive update", "customer communication", "engineering status", "investor update"

**Workflow:**
1. Determine update type (weekly, monthly, launch, ad-hoc) and audience (exec, engineering, partners, customers, board)
2. Pull context from connected tools (project tracker status, chat for decisions, meeting notes, metrics data)
3. Generate tailored update for audience using templates below
4. Format for delivery channel (email, doc, chat, slides)

**Update Templates by Audience:**

**Executive / Leadership Update:**
```
Status: [Green / Yellow / Red]

TL;DR: [One sentence — the most important thing to know]

Progress:
- [Outcome achieved, tied to goal/OKR]
- [Milestone reached, with impact]
- [Key metric movement]

Risks:
- [Risk]: [Mitigation plan]. [Ask if needed].

Decisions needed:
- [Decision]: [Options with recommendation]. Need by [date].

Next milestones:
- [Milestone] — [Date]
```

Keep under 200 words. Lead with conclusion. Status color reflects genuine assessment. Only include risks where you need help. Asks must be specific: "Decision on X by Friday" not "support needed."

**Engineering Team Update:**
```
Shipped:
- [Feature/fix] — [Link to PR/ticket]. [Impact if notable].

In progress:
- [Item] — [Owner]. [Expected completion]. [Blockers if any].

Decisions:
- [Decision made]: [Rationale]. [Link to ADR if exists].
- [Decision needed]: [Context]. [Options]. [Recommendation].

Priority changes:
- [What changed and why]

Coming up:
- [Next items] — [Context on why these are next]
```

Link to specific tickets, PRs, documents. Explain why priorities changed. Be explicit about blockers and mitigation.

**Cross-Functional Partner Update:**
```
What's coming:
- [Feature/launch] — [Date]. [What this means for your team].

What we need from you:
- [Specific ask] — [Context]. By [date].

Decisions made:
- [Decision] — [How it affects your team].

Open for input:
- [Topic we'd love feedback on] — [How to provide it].
```

**Customer / External Update:**
```
What's new:
- [Feature] — [Benefit in customer terms]. [How to use it / link].

Coming soon:
- [Feature] — [Expected timing]. [Why it matters to you].

Known issues:
- [Issue] — [Status]. [Workaround if available].

Feedback:
- [How to share feedback or request features]
```

No internal jargon. No ticket numbers. Frame in terms of what customer can DO. Honest about timelines but no overcommit.

**Status Reporting Framework:**

**Green** (On Track): Progressing as planned, no significant risks/blockers, on track to meet commitments.

**Yellow** (At Risk): Slower progress or materialized risk, mitigation underway but outcome uncertain, may miss commitments without intervention.

**Red** (Off Track): Significantly behind plan, major blocker without clear mitigation, will miss commitments without significant intervention.

**ROAM Framework for Risk Management:**
- **Resolved**: Risk no longer a concern. Document how.
- **Owned**: Risk acknowledged, someone actively managing. State owner and mitigation.
- **Accepted**: Known but proceeding without mitigation. Document rationale.
- **Mitigated**: Actions reduced risk to acceptable level. Document what was done.

**Risk Communication (5 Steps):**
1. State risk clearly: "There is a risk that [thing] happens because [reason]"
2. Quantify impact: "Consequence is [impact]"
3. State likelihood: "[Likely/Possible/Unlikely] because [evidence]"
4. Present mitigation: "We are managing this by [actions]"
5. Make ask: "We need [specific help]"

**Outputs:** Tailored status update in chosen format and delivery channel, ADRs for major decisions, follow-up artifacts (one-pager for exec summary, communication plan for changes)

### 6. Synthesize Research

**Trigger:** "synthesize research", "analyze user interviews", "synthesis of feedback", "research insights", "user research summary", "feedback themes"

**Workflow:**
1. Accept research from any source: pasted text, uploaded files, connected knowledge base, user feedback tools, analytics, meeting transcripts
2. Extract key observations: What users said, did, experienced? Quotes? Pain points? Positive signals? Context?
3. Apply thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes across sources
4. Generate synthesis with research overview, key findings, user segments, opportunities, recommendations, open questions

**Research Synthesis Methodology:**

**Thematic Analysis (Core Method):**
1. **Familiarization**: Read all data. Get feel for landscape before coding.
2. **Initial coding**: Systematically tag observations, quotes, data points with descriptive codes. Be generous with codes.
3. **Theme development**: Group related codes into candidate themes. Theme captures something important about data in relation to research question.
4. **Theme review**: Check themes against data. Sufficient evidence? Distinct from each other? Coherent story?
5. **Theme refinement**: Define and name each theme. Write 1-2 sentence description.
6. **Report**: Write up themes as findings with supporting evidence.

**Affinity Mapping (Collaborative):**
1. Write each observation as separate note
2. Cluster related notes based on similarity (let categories emerge)
3. Label clusters with descriptive name
4. Arrange clusters into higher-level groups if patterns emerge
5. Identify themes from clusters and relationships

Tips: One observation per note. Move notes freely. Large clusters = multiple themes, split. Outliers are interesting.

**Triangulation** (Strengthen Findings):
- **Methodological**: Same question, different methods (interviews + survey + analytics)
- **Source**: Same method, different participants or segments
- **Temporal**: Same observation at different points in time

Finding supported by multiple sources/methods is stronger than single source.

**Key Findings Priority Matrix:**

| | High Frequency | Low Frequency |
|---------|---|---|
| **High Impact** | Top priority | Important for specific segments |
| **Low Impact** | Quality-of-life improvements | Note but deprioritize |

**Research Synthesis Output Structure:**

```
## Research Overview
- Methodology: types of research, number of participants/sources
- Research question(s): what we set out to learn
- Timeframe: when research conducted

## Key Findings (5-8, ordered by priority)
**Finding**: One clear sentence describing insight
**Evidence**: Supporting quotes, data points, observations (with attribution)
**Frequency**: How many participants/sources support this
**Impact**: How significantly this affects UX or business
**Confidence**: High (strong evidence) / Medium (suggestive) / Low (early signal)

## User Segments / Personas
- Segment name and description
- Key characteristics and behaviors
- Unique needs and pain points
- Size estimate

## Opportunity Areas
- What user needs are unmet
- Where solutions fall short
- What new capabilities unlock value
- Prioritized by potential impact

## Recommendations
- What to build, change, or investigate
- Tied back to specific findings
- Prioritized by impact and feasibility

## Open Questions
- Gaps in understanding
- Areas needing further investigation
- Suggested follow-up research methods
```

**Interview Analysis:**

Extract from each interview:
- **Observations**: What participant described doing, experiencing, feeling
- **Direct quotes**: Verbatim statements illustrating points (attribute to type, not name)
- **Behaviors vs stated preferences**: What they DO vs SAID they want (behaviors are stronger evidence)
- **Signals of intensity**: Emotional language, frequency, workarounds, impact

Cross-interview analysis:
- Patterns across multiple participants
- Frequency of themes
- Distinct user segments
- Contradictions (often reveal meaningful segments)
- Surprises

**Survey Data Interpretation:**

Quantitative:
- Response rate and representativeness
- Distribution (not just averages). Bimodal ≠ normal.
- Segmentation by user type
- Statistical significance (be cautious with small samples)
- Benchmark comparison

Open-ended:
- Treat like mini interview notes
- Code with themes
- Count frequency
- Pull representative quotes
- Look for uncovered themes

**Combining Qual and Quant:**
- Qual first (what/why via hypotheses)
- Quant validation (how much/many via testing)
- Qual deep-dive (explain unexpected quant findings)

Use quant to prioritize qual findings. Use qual to explain quant anomalies.

**Opportunity Sizing:**

For each finding, estimate:
- **Addressable users**: How many could benefit (use analytics, survey, market data)
- **Frequency**: How often do affected users encounter (daily, weekly, monthly, one-time)
- **Severity**: How much does issue impact (blocker, friction, minor annoyance)
- **Willingness to pay**: Would addressing drive upgrades, retention, acquisition?

Score opportunities on: Impact (Users × Frequency × Severity), Evidence strength, Strategic alignment, Feasibility.

**Outputs:** Research synthesis document with all sections above, persona documents, opportunity maps, research presentations, product roadmap implications, follow-up research plans

### 7. Competitive Brief

**Trigger:** "competitive analysis", "how do we compare to", "competitive brief", "battle card for", "competitive landscape", "win/loss analysis"

**Workflow:**
1. Scope analysis: Which competitor(s)? Feature area or full product? What decision?
2. Research via web search, connected knowledge base, chat history
3. Generate brief with competitor overview, feature comparison, positioning, strengths/weaknesses, opportunities, threats, implications

**Competitive Landscape Mapping:**

**Direct competitors**: Same problem, same users, same way. Your customers evaluate against you. Appear in deals.

**Indirect competitors**: Same problem, different approach (spreadsheets vs dedicated tool). Different path to value.

**Adjacent competitors**: Do not compete today but could. Similar tech, customer base, distribution. Could expand into your space.

**Substitute solutions**: Entirely different ways to solve need (hiring person, outsourcing, general-purpose tools).

**Landscape Map Axes** (position competitors to reveal strategy):
- Breadth vs depth (suite vs point solution)
- SMB vs enterprise (market segment)
- Self-serve vs sales-led (go-to-market)
- Simple vs powerful (product complexity)
- Horizontal vs vertical (general purpose vs industry-specific)

**Feature Comparison Matrices:**

Define capability areas using buyer language (not internal architecture). List specific capabilities. Rate each competitor.

**Rating Scales:**

Simple (recommended):
- **Strong**: Market-leading. Deep, well-executed.
- **Adequate**: Functional. Gets job done without differentiation.
- **Weak**: Exists but limited. Significant gaps.
- **Absent**: Does not have.

Detailed (deep-dive):
- 5: Best-in-class
- 4: Strong
- 3: Adequate
- 2: Limited
- 1: Minimal
- 0: Absent

Tips: Rate on real product experience, customer feedback, reviews (not marketing). Weight by what matters to target customers. Update regularly. Be honest about where competitors lead. Include "why it matters."

**Positioning Analysis:**

Extract positioning statement:
> For [target customer] who [need], [Product] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [competitor], [Product] [key differentiator].

Message architecture levels:
- **Level 1 — Category**: What category? (CRM, project management, collaboration)
- **Level 2 — Differentiator**: What makes them different? (AI-powered, all-in-one, developer-first)
- **Level 3 — Value Proposition**: What outcome? (Close deals faster, ship faster, never miss deadline)
- **Level 4 — Proof Points**: What evidence? (Logos, metrics, awards, case studies)

Look for unclaimed positions, crowded claims, emerging positions, vulnerable claims.

**Win/Loss Analysis:**

Most actionable competitive intelligence.

Data sources: CRM notes (biased), customer interviews post-decision (most valuable), churn surveys, prospect surveys.

Win/Loss interview questions:
- What problem were you solving?
- What alternatives did you evaluate? (Reveals competitive set)
- Why did you choose us/them? (for wins/losses)
- What almost changed your mind?
- What would make you reconsider?

Analyze: Track reasons over time. Segment by deal type (enterprise vs SMB, new vs expansion, vertical). Top 3-5 reasons for wins/losses. Product vs non-product reasons. Win rates by competitor.

Common patterns: Feature gap, integration advantage, pricing structure, incumbent advantage, sales execution, brand/trust.

**Market Trend Identification:**

Sources: Analyst reports, VC funding, conference themes, technology shifts, regulatory changes, customer behavior, talent movement.

For each trend:
1. What is changing? (Clear, specific)
2. Why now? (What is driving?)
3. Who affected? (Which segments/markets?)
4. Timeline? (Now, 1-2 years, 3-5 years?)
5. Implication for us? (How should this influence strategy?)
6. What are competitors doing? (How are they responding?)

Separate signal from noise: Behaviors, data, investment, regulation, customer demand = signal. Media hype, conference buzz, announcements without traction = noise.

Strategic response options: Lead (invest early), Fast follow (wait for signal then move fast), Monitor (track but do not invest yet), Ignore (explicit decision with documentation).

**Competitive Brief Output Structure:**

```
## Competitor Overview
For each competitor:
- Company summary: founding, size, funding/revenue, target market

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Specification from Customer Request
1. Receive problem statement or feature request from Sales/Customers
2. Validate with user research data (`/synthesize-research` skill)
3. Draft spec with goals, acceptance criteria, phased delivery (`/write-spec` skill)
4. Review with Engineering for feasibility and effort
5. Socialize with stakeholders via update (`/stakeholder-update` skill)
6. Add to roadmap with priority and dependencies (`/roadmap-update` skill)
7. Include in next sprint plan (`/sprint-planning` skill)

### Workflow 2: Quarterly Roadmap Planning with Research & Metrics
1. Review product metrics from last quarter (`/metrics-review` skill)
2. Identify underperforming areas and optimization opportunities
3. Synthesize user research and customer feedback (`/synthesize-research` skill)
4. Conduct competitive analysis on key feature areas (`/competitive-brief` skill)
5. Run RICE prioritization on candidate initiatives
6. Create Now/Next/Later roadmap (`/roadmap-update` skill)
7. Present to leadership with strategic rationale (`/stakeholder-update` skill)
8. Kick off first sprint of quarter (`/sprint-planning` skill)

### Workflow 3: Sprint Execution with Metrics Tracking
1. Plan sprint with capacity and prioritized backlog (`/sprint-planning` skill)
2. Mid-sprint check on progress and blockers
3. Review daily standup updates
4. On sprint end, gather metrics on feature performance (`/metrics-review` skill)
5. Analyze any performance anomalies or unexpected findings
6. Share sprint retrospective and metrics review with team (`/stakeholder-update` skill)
7. Feed learnings into roadmap and next sprint planning

### Workflow 4: Competitive Threat Response
1. Market intelligence suggests competitor launching similar feature
2. Quick competitive analysis (`/competitive-brief` skill) to understand threat
3. Synthesize customer research on how our approach differs (`/synthesize-research` skill)
4. Decide: accelerate feature, differentiate positioning, or focus elsewhere
5. Update roadmap and communicate decision to stakeholders (`/roadmap-update` + `/stakeholder-update` skills)

## Best Practices & Guidelines

1. **Research-Backed Decisions**: Ground roadmap and spec decisions in user research, market data, or customer feedback. No decisions on opinion alone.
2. **Phased Delivery**: Break features into MVP + phases to accelerate customer value. Launch fast, learn, iterate.
3. **Dependency Management**: Proactively identify and communicate dependencies to avoid surprises. Have contingency plans.
4. **Metrics-Driven**: Link features and initiatives to measurable business outcomes. Use leading indicators as early warning system.
5. **Transparent Prioritization**: Articulate why decisions were made. Communicate trade-offs explicitly. Show what moved to make room.
6. **Capacity Realism**: Do not solve capacity problems by pretending people can do more. Solve by cutting scope. Better to commit to less and deliver reliably.
7. **Async-First Communication**: Rely on written specs and docs for decisions. Use Slack for quick questions.
8. **Regular Cadence**: Sprint planning, roadmap reviews, metrics checks on predictable schedules. Consistency builds trust.
9. **Document Everything**: Specs, roadmaps, decisions searchable and up-to-date. Decisions recorded (ADRs). Research archived.
10. **Close the Loop**: Show how customer feedback influenced roadmap. Report back to customers on implemented requests.

## Purpose

This agent handles all software engineering workflows — from code review and architecture decisions to system design, debugging, testing, deployment, incident response, and technical debt management. It is backed by the installed `engineering` plugin and connected to live GitHub, Zoho Sprints, Zoho Projects, Slack, Google Drive, Discord, and Figma integrations.

> **Disclaimer:** This agent assists with software engineering workflows but does not provide definitive architectural or security guidance. All critical decisions, security reviews, and production deployments should be validated by qualified engineers and followed up with proper testing and peer review before implementation.

## Skills (Detailed Reference)

### 1. Code Review

**Trigger:** PR URL, diff, "review this before I merge", "is this code safe?", "code review", GitHub pull request link

**Review Dimensions:**
- **Security** — SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, privilege escalation, exposed secrets/API keys, insecure cryptography, authentication/authorization flaws, input validation gaps, dependency vulnerabilities

**Checklist:** Security scan, performance profiling, unit test review, integration coverage, code style compliance, naming clarity, documentation presence, SOLID principle adherence, error handling completeness, API contract validation.

**Outputs:** Line-by-line feedback with severity, specific examples, suggested fixes, summary matrix (security/perf/correctness/tests), approval decision with conditions.

---

### 2. Architecture

**Trigger:** Technology selection, "Kafka vs SQS", trade-off analysis, migration planning, ADR, design decision, "how should we architect"

**Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Format:**
- **Title** — Concise decision summary
- **Status** — Proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- **Context** — Problem statement, constraints, requirements

- **Non-Functional Requirements** — Scale (requests/sec, storage), latency (p50, p99), availability/uptime SLA, consistency model (strong, eventual), security requirements
- **Service Decomposition** — Define service boundaries, responsibilities, communication patterns, data ownership
- **API Design** — REST, GraphQL, gRPC trade-offs; request/response contracts, pagination, versioning, error handling, rate limiting

**Common Patterns:** Saga pattern for distributed transactions, CQRS for read/write separation, event sourcing for audit trails, bulkhead for isolation, circuit breaker for fault tolerance.

**Outputs:** Architecture diagram, service specification document, API contracts, data model, scaling analysis, risk/mitigation matrix.

---

### 4. Debug

**Trigger:** Error messages, stack traces, "works in staging but not prod", behavior diverges from expected, "why is this broken"

**Structured Debugging Process:**

1. **Reproduce** — Understand environment (staging/prod), timing, frequency, impact scope; create minimal reproducible example
2. **Isolate** — Narrow down to specific component, input, or condition; eliminate variables
3. **Diagnose** — Examine logs, traces, metrics; analyze root cause (code logic, configuration, data, dependencies, environment)
4. **Fix** — Implement fix with regression test coverage
5. **Validate** — Verify fix in local, staging, and production environments

**Investigation Techniques:**
- **Logs Analysis** — Search for errors, warnings, timeouts; trace request ID through logs; identify correlation with failures
- **Metrics & Monitoring** — CPU/memory/disk usage, response times, error rates, dependency health
- **Code Inspection** — Trace execution path, identify null pointer risks, race conditions, off-by-one errors, missing checks
- **Data Validation** — Check input values, database state, cache consistency, FX rates, time zones
- **Configuration Review** — Environment variables, feature flags, thresholds, timeouts, retry policies
- **Dependency Health** — External API status, database connection pools, message queue health, downstream service availability

**Common Root Causes Checklist:** Missing null checks, race conditions, off-by-one errors, incorrect logic, stale cache, configuration mismatch, permission issues, resource exhaustion, timeout too short, data inconsistency, timezone bugs, FX rate issues, wrong environment assumptions.

**Outputs:** Root cause identification, detailed reproduction steps, explanation of bug mechanism, code fix with regression test, preventive measures to avoid recurrence.

---

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Trigger:** "How should we test", "Test strategy for", "What tests do we need", testing plan, test architecture, coverage planning

**Test Strategy Components:**

**Testing Pyramid:**
```
      /\
     /  \  E2E & Acceptance (10%)
    /    \
   /      \  Integration & Contract Tests (30%)
  /________\
 /          \  Unit Tests (60%)
/____________\
```

**Test Types:**
- **Unit Tests** — Individual functions/methods in isolation; fast, deterministic, comprehensive coverage (80%+)
- **Integration Tests** — Components working together (e.g., API + database); moderate speed, realistic data flows
- **Contract Tests** — API contracts between services validated without full E2E; prevent integration surprises
- **E2E / Acceptance Tests** — Full user workflows through UI or API; slower, high value, critical paths only
- **Performance Tests** — Load testing, stress testing, spike testing; latency and throughput validation
- **Security Tests** — OWASP Top 10, injection, XSS, auth bypass, privilege escalation, secrets in code
- **Chaos Engineering** — Deliberate failure injection (network partitions, instance failures, latency spikes)

**Coverage Planning by Risk:**
| Component Type | Minimum Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Business Logic | 80% | Core algorithms, calculations |
| API Endpoints | 70% | Happy path + key error cases |
| Edge Cases | 100% | Boundary conditions, nulls, empties |
| Error Paths | 90% | Exception handling, retries, fallbacks |
| Legacy Code | 50% | Regression prevention priority |

**Test Data & Environments:**
- Test data generation (fixtures, factories, builders)
- Environment parity (local, staging, production-like)
- Secrets management (no hardcoded credentials)
- Data cleanup and isolation

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Automated test execution on every commit
- Quality gates (coverage thresholds, SLA compliance)
- Test failure notifications
- Performance trend tracking

**Outputs:** Test strategy document with pyramid breakdown, coverage goals by component, test plan with prioritized test cases, performance benchmarks, security test checklist, CI/CD quality gates.
